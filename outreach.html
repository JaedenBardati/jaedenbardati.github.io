                                <h3>Caltech Project for Effective Teaching Co-Director</h3>
                                <p>
                                    As co-director of the Caltech Project for Effective Teaching (CPET, now rebranded to CFAM, a part of the Caltech Teaching Learning and Outreach department), I am excited to help foster an evidence-based teaching community at Caltech and to cultivate an environment where teaching is approached with the same curiosity and rigor as research. My duties include overseing graduate student certificate programs in university teaching, planning and leads workshops, seminars and discussion groups on effective teaching for TAs and postdocs, and is responsible for training all new graduate students as teaching assistants. I also have given invited talks on related topics in other departments including the Caltech Mathematics Teaching Seminar.
                                </p>

                                <h3>PMA Graduate Student Advisory Board Representative</h3>
                                <p>
                                    I serve as a member of the student advisory board for the Physics, Mathematics and Astronomy (PMA) division at Caltech. As a representative of PMA students, I advise the division on topics important to students, share feedback on student needs, and help provide insights and planning for future and ongoing student programming.
                                </p>

                                <h3>Recurring Caltech Astro Outreach Volunteer</h3>
                                <p>
                                    I am a regular volunteer for the Caltech astrophysics department outreach program. This includes operating telescopes, engaging with the audience, selling merch and helping setup/takedown at Astro on Tap events, and sitting on the Q&amp;A Panel for the Stargazing lecture series.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    I have served as the primary research mentor (on projects of my design) for 6 undergraduate and community college students through the Caltech Connections and Caltech First-Year Success Research Institute programs, as well as for a summer research student, co-mentored with Saul Teukolsky. I have also served as a recurring academic mentor for 8+ other undergraduate and graduate students through the American Astronomical Society (AAS) Division of Dynamical Astronomy (DDA) mentoring program, the Caltech Accountability Partners Program (CAPP) and the Caltech Physics, Mathematics and Astronomy Department mentor program.
                                </p>

                                <h3>Volunteer Fair and Poster Judging</h3>
                                <p>
                                    It is my pleasure to continually serve as a judge at various science fairs and scientific poster comptetitions. In Fall 2025, I served as a poster judge for the Caltech Seminar Day (a conference for Caltech undergraduate research projects). I also served on a panel of judges in the California Science and Engineering Fair (CSEF) for its Physics &amp; Astronomy (Senior) Category Award and honourable mentions in April 2024. I also served on a panel of 5 judges to select delegates from finalists of the Orange County Science &amp; Engineering Fair (<a href="https://ocsef.org/">OCSEF</a>) to proceed on to the International Science and Engineering Fair (<a href="https://www.societyforscience.org/isef/">ISEF</a>) in March 2024. We conducted interviews of the students and had the opportunity to move for the top projects for final consideration as ISEF Finalists or Alternates.

                                <h3>Volunteer Tutor</h3>
                                <p>
                                    It is a passion of mine to help students who are stuggling in class and who might not have access to the same resources as some others do. For this reason, I choose to volunteer as a tutor for Pasadena City College students. In the past, I would also volunteer tutor public middle and high school students in math and science every week through the Caltech Y Rise Program.
                                </p>

                                <h3>Astronomy, Mathematics and Physics Society (AMPS)</h3>
                                <p>
                                    At Bishop's University, I co-founded and co-led the Astronomy, Mathematics and Physics Society (AMPS). This involved organizing meetings with our over 60 recruited members, coding and managing a publicly-accessible club website, organizing physics and astronomy-related AMPS projects and events (such as sky viewings at the university observatory, graduate school preparation seminars, physics trivia nights, math integration bees, etc.), creating detailed budgets of event expenses, and contacting speakers. For more information, <a href="https://buamps.ca/">here is its website</a>.

                                <p>
                                    At Bishop's University, I took course notes for students with accessibility needs for 10 classes. <a href=documents/sample_notes_cs201.pdf>Here</a> is a sample of notes from Introduction to Computer Science (CS201) at Bishop's University,
